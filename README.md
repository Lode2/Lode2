Hi, I'm Lode!
My GitHub page is currently mostly for personal projects, which might end up being publicised.

I have experience in Python, JavaScript (also HTML and CSS) and Rust.

I am a physics and astronomy student. This is where I got introduced to programming (Python specifically).

I learned JavaScript to be able to create websites. I have experience working with ReactJS and NextJS. Obviously I am thus also experienced in HTML and CSS.

I started learning Rust because I wanted to learn a low-level programming language and Rust seemed to be the most popular modern one, which attracted me to it.

You can reach me via email at lode685@gmail.com for any questions :).
